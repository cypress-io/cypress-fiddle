Another `should(cb)` example where we use `cy.wrap` with a custom timeout option to make sure the callback function retries for a longer period.

<!-- fiddle Custom timeout -->
```js
let x
// note that 5 seconds it longer than the default command retry timeout
setTimeout(() => x = 'foo', 5000)

cy.log('waiting for **x**')
// should(cb) retries its callback function
// as long as the previous command's timeout defines
// (or the default command timeout)
// we can even write command and assertion separately
// yet they are still connected
cy.wrap(null, {timeout: 5100})
cy.should(() => {
  expect(x).to.equal('foo')
})
```
